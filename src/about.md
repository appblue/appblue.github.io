# {{ title }}

Hi! I'm Chris. Thanks for checking out my blog!

I'm mostly interested in technical topics related to computers, programming - both high level (in languages like Lisp, Python, C++, Go), but also low-level programming and reverse engineering. I have spent a lot of my primary/high school days programming Z80 and Motorola 68000 assembly, and I have a tendency to go back to those topics out of pure nostalgia.

I treat this blog as a kind of a notepad for myself, but I surely hope that someone else might find it useful or interesting.
